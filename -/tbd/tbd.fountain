		**PAN DOWN FROM THE SUN**

## Act One 

EXT. CAT LAIR

Cats everywhere.

A lone dog rests back on his laurels,
atop a shady outcropping;
purveying.


## Act Two - A Cat's Bark

EXT. THE FARM

		FLUFFY
	(exasperated)

If only I could bark like a dog.


## Act Three - Purrs for the Future

EXT. CAT LAIR

		LONE DOG

Ruff.
