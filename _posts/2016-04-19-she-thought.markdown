She thought he was her friend.

It was hot,
so he cut her some slack.

Her place was a mess;
sort of a cross between
a thing that no-one likes
and a thing that everyone wants.

And,
it was probably the chair
that got him.

"Vacation is for losers"
he had claimed;
not even remotely interested
in spending a week or two.

She likes to travel,
he had explained;
feigning disinterest.

Unfortunately,
she thought he was funny.

Stupid gait analysis.

He told her he'd be right back
but he didn't know that she
likes Cracker Jacks,
and not Sour Patches
or popcorn, soda, and JuJuBe's.

It wasn't the movie,
he explained;
it was the dinner.

She tried to walk.

He didn't think it was working out;
but couldn't have been more wrong.

"Cool braid",
he wanted to say;
but, instead,
the lady at the counter picked for him.

"That's not a bearclaw!"

"You looked like you needed it."
