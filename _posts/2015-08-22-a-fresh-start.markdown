It was unclear whether
he had been supposed to be writing a screenplay;
or something else, rather.

Something else, entirely.

As though he had arranged,
for visitors thence.

She hadn't been there for days, clearly,
as the dishes were still in the dishwasher;
his hair a mess,
hers strewn down the tub drain.

"Take her some roses", he thought to himself
in regards to her;
and his needs.

He had forgotten, again,
and this time it was bad.

As though she hadn't reminded him
of his obligations; proprietarily.

It was supposed to be in screenplay form;
but this time,
this time it was <dinosaurs>
and he couldn't bare it.

So there they were,
undescriptly posturing
and he had thought that the form
wasn't of import.

However,
they were indeed prepared
for what may come of
their decision to
just drop it all
and do this good.

Her part was finished;
it was his that was incomplete
subterranianly,
like a <comparative>,
for the ages,
as it were;
and, indeed, dearest.

"Maybe a fresh start," they thought together.

A change of scene, a focus on priorities,
an avoidance of other responsibilities
in order to succeed.

"The best possible chance to succeed," they rationalized.

"Necessary, even,"

So, they went and did,
and hardly anyone was the wiser;
quietly, surely, slowly.

They had considered eating their cucumber plant,
however.

Conditions were quite amenable;
multiply-fulfilled,
satisfied;
somewhat regularly.

"An appropriate vessel will be necessary," they thought.

Spacecraft? Check.

"Should this thing float?" he thought,
having been an avid swimmer,
and somewhat of an onlooker.

"I learned about underwater vehicles once."

"Once, Twice, Three times a <lady|tramp|winner>"

"Do you think that we should mount our spacecraft?"

"He's unprepared for this"

"What does she know about winning?"

"Yup, a fresh start."

He had been planning to get her a headband;
nothing fancy. It was to be a surprise;
a friendly relief from the heat
and ambient perspiration.

"He's not going to just stop what he's doing."

She couldn't comprehend the magnamanminity of his plan.

Unawares of his careful forethought,
she proceeded tentatively with
similar obligationx.

"Oh, what would they say"

He had located a secluded outcropping
outside an oasis,
with water aplenty
and a view of the stars.

"Sharks or wolves?"

Palm trees.

"He will block."

I'm sure there's something I could be doing;
I should learn to teach.

"What would you teach?"

She can't even hear me
gently rapping.

"I can hear you fr***ing wrapping."
