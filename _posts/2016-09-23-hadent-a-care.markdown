```fountain

He hadn't a care in the world.

Just one of those picturesque
moments.


where the sun is shining
and the beautiful
weather
is cooperating.

subtlely,
he firmly
patted
his old

a) briefcase
b) dog's head
c) spouse's appendage


"Because you've gotta make a decision,
you know.

You've got a decision to make."

He overheard;
and misunderstood.

You see,
he had believed that
it was supposed to be his day;
what with all of the plannings for
the social event
that wore forthcoming.

He had taken a walk
for a moment.

Just a stroll, really.

"Yup, you get the best of her"
He had said,
regarding her.


It had been a really short walk to her car.

He had forgotten his shades
again.
