"I want you to call me
Happenstance"


We are not calling you
"happenstance"


"I want you to call me
Happenstance
because:
- no one would know who you are talking about
-
"

We are not calling you
"happenstance"

"What about happenedstance;
it's not already taken?"

Like the whole phrase
"happenedstance; it's not already taken"?

"Maybe just 'ned', for short?"
```
